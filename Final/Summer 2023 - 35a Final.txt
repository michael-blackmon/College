static int x;
Test1() {
        System.out.printf(“Making objects”);
}
public abstract void restful(int x);
}
public class Test2 extends Test1 {
        public void restful(int x) { 
                System.out.printf(“class Test2”);
        }
}
public class Test3 extends Test1 {
        Test3()
        {
                super();
        }
        public void restful(int x) { 
                System.out.printf(“class Test3”);
        }
}
public class Driver {
public static void main(String [] args)
{
Test2 a1 = new Test1();
Test3 a2 = new Test();
a1.restful(15);
a2.restful(20);
Test a3 [] = new Test[5];
for(int i=0;i<a3.length;i++)
 if (i%2)
        a3[i] = new Test2();
 else
a3[i] = new Test3();        


for(int i=0;i<a3.length;i++)
        a3[i].restful[10];        
}
}
