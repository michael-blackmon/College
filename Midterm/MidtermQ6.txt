Question 6

A:

i = 1; 0 + 1 * 2; sum = 2
i = 2; 2 + 2 = 4; sum = 4
i = 3; 4 + 3 * 2; sum = 10
i = 4; 10 + 4 * 2; sum = 18
i = 5; 18 + 5 * 2; sum = 28



B:
variable c is declared as an int, but the operation is trying to do addition with 
a floating point number. To receive the intended value for c, we have to declare as
double.

double c;
c = 4.8 + 2;

we get: c = 6.8


C:
3.14f is a float, as it has the 'f' keyword
1.56 is a double as it doesn't specify otherwise, in Java the default for floating point numbers is double
'a' is a char as it is encased in a single quote
"true" is a String as it is encased in a double quote; if it was true by itself I would say boolean
